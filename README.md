## Project Overview
The e-commerce company is dedicated to transforming online shopping experiences and it Specializes in cutting-edge solution by harnessing technology to redefine customer engagement. Businesses face challenges in 
personalizing their interactions with customers, resulting in missed opportunities for targeted marketing and improved customer satisfaction.

## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to create an effective Customer Segmentation system that goes beyond traditional demographic classifications. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the system will analyze diverse data points to identify
nuanced customer segments.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics. The dataset contains features as gender, customer ID, category, region, Payment method, Quantity ordered, customer since and other relevant information

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I performed data wrangling, conducted univariate and bivariate analysis, showing correlations between variables and drawing out inferences. checked for missing values and duplicates in my dataset. Most importantly, 
feature engineering was performed to extract relevant information from my raw data

## Data Preprocessing
I performed exploratory data analysis, encoding of categorical variables, normalization of my data which entails scaling the features before feeding the data into the machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Model
The K-means algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This algorithm is used when we have unlabelled data. Unlabelled data means input data without categories or groups provided.
